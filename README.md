Hello, my English name is Jimmy Kmi. When 2004 I'm 3, start drawing in Guangzhou Children's Palace, keep drawing till now. when 2008, I start coding HTML in primary school and start creating my first VisualBasic program in 2013 in middle school. In 2015 I build my first website to release my VisualBasic application and learned PHP in 2017, now I build multiple with traditional HTML or with Angular.
In 2006 I try to use a battery to light up a tiny lightbulb, day by day I'd build my own led night light with a battery or power supply when I'm still studying in primary school. So hard, I keep making "light" or "flashlight" till I‘m in high school. In 2018, I found a platform called Arduino, yes, I start creating Arduino projects, like airconditioner controller in high school, smart lock in college etc. In 2019, I used Arduino to connect wifi, success, and use my PHP program to connect with Arduino board, remote control, success!keeps going, I'll never stop learning.
I've been to some European and middle-east countries, learned some different cultures, design, tho English isn't my mother language, I'm would like to contact some friendly people in English or your mother language, If you have an Idea which would like to share with me, contact me!
